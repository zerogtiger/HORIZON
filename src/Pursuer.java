/*

Description:

Responsible for "chasing" the speeder as reflected through a numerical value of the relative distance between the two,
which is rendered graphically in the HUD class. Updates the relative distance to the speeder every game tick depending
on the speeder's velocity and distance travelled. Renders the pursuer's "net" to catch the speeder only when the
relative distance is reduced to a certain amount to make the user panik.
